# 🖼️ Image Captioning & Segmentation
📌 Project Title / Headline

VisionAI: Image Captioning & Object Segmentation Tool
An AI-powered tool that automatically generates descriptive captions for images and segments objects within them using pre-trained deep learning models.

🎯 Short Description / Purpose

The Image Captioning & Segmentation Project enables users to generate accurate textual descriptions of images and visualize segmented objects.

It is designed for AI enthusiasts, researchers, and developers interested in computer vision applications and automated image analysis.

⚙️ Tech Stack

The project uses the following technologies:

Python 3.13 → Main programming language.

PyTorch & Torchvision → Deep learning framework for computer vision tasks.

Transformers (Hugging Face) → Pre-trained BLIP model for image captioning.

Pillow (PIL) → Image loading and processing.

Matplotlib → Visualization of segmented images.

SpaCy & NLTK → NLP tools for text processing.

Streamlit (optional) → Web-based interactive deployment.

📊 Data Source

Input images can be of any type (JPEG, PNG, etc.)

BLIP Model → Salesforce/blip-image-captioning-base for generating captions.

Mask R-CNN → Pre-trained segmentation model for object detection.

💾 Pre-trained models are fetched from Hugging Face Hub, so no additional dataset is required.

🌟 Features / Highlights

The project provides insights in the following format:

Automatic Image Captioning → Generates descriptive captions for images.

Object Segmentation → Detects and segments objects in images.

Combined Workflow → Caption and segmentation can be performed in a single step.

Visualization → Segmented images displayed with clear plots.

Flexible Input → Works with images from your local machine.
